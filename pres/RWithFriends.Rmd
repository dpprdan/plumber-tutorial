# Deployment Basic

  - Start with built in digital ocean method*
  
  - Entry point $5 per month

# Deployment Advanced

  - install web server manually and configure resources (Docker Compose or pm2)*
  
  - multiple R processes running concurrently
  
  - harder to do but more scaleable

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rage2.jpg")
```

.footnote[[*] Plumber Docs https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html]

# Deployment Experimental

  - Configure app engine on Google Cloud Compute*
  
  - Harder, less support but most scaleable and fully managed

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rage3.png")
```
